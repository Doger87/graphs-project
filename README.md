# Assignment 6 - C++ Graph Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a C++ implementation of a graph-based algorithm as part of **Assignment 6** for my Data Structures and Algorithms course. The program includes key features such as graph creation, shortest path computation, and adjacency list management using custom C++ classes.

## 🧠 Features

- Graph representation using adjacency lists
- Reading graph data from input
- Outputting formatted path results
- Sorting and traversal of graph nodes
- Memory-safe usage with pointers and custom classes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Eclipse CDT
- **Compiler:** g++ (via Eclipse or terminal)
